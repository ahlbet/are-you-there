    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
    And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd.`

    Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
    Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
    And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
    ‘Tis but thy name that is my enemy:
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
    What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot
    Nor arm nor face nor any other part
    Belonging to a man.`

    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
    Live here in heaven and may look on her;
    But Romeo may not: more validity,
    More honourable state, more courtship lives
    In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips.`

Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, by use all gently, for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness.'

    You must not dare for shame to talk of mercy;

    See you, my princes and my noble peers,
    These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here--
    You know how apt our love was to accord.`

    Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her.
    She made good view of me; indeed, so much
    That, as methought, her eyes had lost her tongue,
    For she did speak in starts distractedly.
    She loves me sure; the cunning of her passion
    Invites me in this churlish messenger.
    None of my lord's ring? Why, he sent her none.
    I am the man. If it be so, as 'tis.`
